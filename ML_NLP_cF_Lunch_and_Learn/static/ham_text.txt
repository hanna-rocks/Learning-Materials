Hi cF team,

Please have a look at this note below from Medallia's tech support team.

Apparently my name is listed as the contact in Medallia's SFDC for Verizon's role/access change requests.   I can certainly help out with the Verizon Business Group requests, but I do not know how to help in the case of the VCG Medallia Mobile piece.

Are you able to assist them?
